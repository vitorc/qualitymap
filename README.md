## About Project

In this project I create some test cases to do a register in [commerce](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/) and also to check if an email already exists using [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework to do these tests.
To check the UI page I'm using some project structure:
- Features using gherking to create all necessaries scenarios
- Page Objects partner to create all necessaries page objects
